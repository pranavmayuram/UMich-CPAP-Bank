			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<br/>

			<p>Imagine not being able to afford a good night’s sleep. Unfortunately, that’s the case for many people who have been prescribed <a href="http://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw48752">continuous positive airway pressure</a> (CPAP) therapy for <a href="http://www.uofmhealth.org/medical-services/brain-neurological-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea">obstructive sleep apnea</a> (OSA) and other sleep disorders. That’s why I created the Michigan CPAP Bank, a recycling program that provides free CPAP machines and supplies to patients in financial need.</p>

			<br/>

			<h4>History</h4>
			<br/>

			<p>In 2012, one of my <a href="http://www.uofmhealth.org/news/cpap-bank-0509">patients</a> brought in his old CPAP machine hoping that another patient might be able to use his equipment. Because he was getting a different CPAP machine to help him breathe at night, he didn’t need the used but still functional equipment. The idea was <strong>brilliant</strong>.</p>
			<br/>

			<h4>Success</h4>
			<br/>

			<p>Today, we have CPAP, BiPAP, auto-CPAP, auto-BiPAP, ASV (adaptive servo-ventilation) and AVAPS (average volume assured pressure support) machines at the Bank. And we have given more than 90 machines and various supplies to people who qualify for them. </p>
